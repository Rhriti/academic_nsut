    MULTIMEDIA CODING 
    Transformation of a string of characters in some representation (such as ASCII) into a new string that contains the same information as the original 
    but length is small as possible. [data compression]

    Shannon’s Communication System Model
        source --- encoding ----> transmit ---- decoding ---> reciever

    why image compression can be done ?
    	 - spatial redundancy
    	 - specteral redundancy
    	 - pysho-visual redundancy

    image compressed ?  Raw image -> [transformer]------[quatiser] --symbols----- [encoder] -- steam of bits\
    keyword : ameable  to compression, scalar and vector quantisation.

    image compresion 2 type [make the diffence table ]
    	KEYS : data elimination, restoration , quality , algo used , file size , use case

    	- lossless :  run length encoding  , huffman coding [(gready) util min heap contains two frequecies/probabilties ]
    	- lossy : transform coding [ffts]

    -------------------------------------------

    COLOR 
    spectrum of light being perceived by the human visual system
    tint, shade, hue, brightness, luminance, color, chromaticity
	Spectral Power Distribution (SPD) of a light is a function P(λ) which defines the power in the light at each wavelength

	3d color spaces :
	  - cubic [rgb]
	  - polar [brigtness , hue]
	  - opposite [r-g b-y black-white]

	 Luminance : dark and light properties 
	 	Luminance, Intensity, Brightness, Lightness
	 chromaticity : 
	 	hue : dominant wavelenght 
	 	saturation/brightness : pure/deep realted to gray

	 The color gamut describes a range of colors within the spectrum of colors, or a color space, that can be reproduced on an output device
	 example : phospor screen

	 RGB space , additive colors
	 CMY space , subractive colors

	 hue saturation value

PPT 2 :
	Stegnography 

	2 words se bna hai [stegno : cover , graphy : writing ]

	one pince of information and hides into another.

	invisible inks, microdots.


	difference table :

	cover, structure remains same , stegno media , confidentialy , attack is called stegnoanalysis


	classfication :
		- pure 
		- public key
		- private key

	principles :
		- significant chnages aren't made while embedding into images
		- human inability to distinguish/hard to detect by visual  

	techniques :
		- substitution
	 	- injections
	 	- generate a new file

	Text Stenography
		- line shift 
		- word shift
		- certain features

	audio stenography
		- sample quantisation 
		- temporal sampling rate : frequencies
		- Perceptual Sampling : audio

	image stenography
		- LSB

	Disadvantage
		can;t protect watermark
		password leakage 
		third party
		degrade or render the image

	Use :
		digital watermarking 
		printers
		medicine 


	steganalysis : practice of attacking stegnography methods for detection , extraction , destruction , alteration

	Classification of attacks : [vo all possible combinations]

	Approaches :
		- visual 
		- structural  [patterns]
		- statistical [mathematical formulas]

	Techniques :
	    - signature : looks for repititive patterns
	    - statistical : statics undergo alteration while 
	         - specific : detailed knowledge of embbedding process
	         - universal : no priori knowledge required, learning models like neural networks

PPT 3 : 
	hide the information in 3 ways 
		cryto , stegno , watermarking 

	A distinguishable mark or device impressed in the substance of a sheet of paper 
	during manufacture, usually barely noticeable except when the sheet is held 
	against strong light.

	Digital watermarking is a technology for embedding various types of
	information in digital content.

	proving the validity of data, protecting copyrights , proving the ownerships

	diff btw stegno and watermarking 

	# watermarking charactertics:
		- imperceptibility : not visible to human eye . 
		- roburstness : the strength of the watermark to obstruct the manipulations of the media.
				(compression , scaling , cropping , shearing  , geometry  , color correction)
		- security : cant detect even if algo is known
		- complexity : amoutn of time to detect
		- verification :
		- payload : info stored. 
		- formed/ public : unwatermarked cover is NOT used in extraction process
		- informed/ private : unwatermarked cover is used in extraction process

	Dual watermark is the combination of visible and invisible watermark. An invisible watermark is used as a backup for the visible watermark


	# classification
		- perceptibilty :
			- visible 
			- invisible :
				fragile : lose their effectiveness when they undergo transformation, , they get destroyed . (compression/resizing , alteration).
					eg : tamper proffing

				semi fragile : image content is basically unchanged, the image is allowed to have a certain degree of distortion

				robust : can survive everything (compression, adding noise, filtering,rotation, scaling translation, shearing[geomerty])

		- procedure type :
			blind (public)  : none of the information of the host is used for excration.
			non blind : some host information is used. less host more complex schemes 

		- misc : 
			private watermarking : requires at least original data to recover watermar (secure).
			public watermarking : doesnot requires  original data to recover watermar (not secure).

		- host signal :
			- audio video text image 

		- domain :
			- spatial (domain): embedding the digital watermark into the cover image or video pixel, 
				done in pixels , host signal me no transformation
				
				least significat bit : 
					[block diagram]
					1. To convert RGB image to gray scale image.
					2. Making double precision for the image.
					3. Shifting most significant bits to low significant bits of ( secret image.)
					4. Make least significant bit of (host image )to zero.
					5. To add shifted version (of step 3) of the watermarked image to modified (of step 4) host image (OR).
				
					easy to implement , lasck robustness, fragile
				
				patchwork :

			- frequency : inserting codes into specific frequency bands of a digital medium ( Gaussian distribution )
				DCT (discreate cosine transform):
				 	divided in different freq bands, middle freq me embed

				 	host image -> block DCT -> watermarking -> inverse DCT
				 													|
				 												[watermarked image]
				 												    |
					decryted <- inverse dct <- ext. watermarking <- block dct

				merits me likh dena cann't be altered, roburst
				demerits: higher frequency components tend to be suppressed during the quantizatio

				DWT (wavelet): bwt low and high frequencies ........... dwt -> watermaking -> idwt -> watermarked image

	#applications :
		- autherization
		- copyright protection 
		- copy protection 
		- transaction tracking
		- montoring
		- tamper proofing

	# life cycle : [block diagram]
		embed : where and how to embed the watermark, extent/ degree of watermark , type/classification of watermark 
					original image ->   watermark algorithm -> watermark image
						|				  ^|		|^ key
					feature selection -> watermark data
		attack :change/alter
		protection : detection
			tested image is extracted and compared with the original watermark
			results can be consistent or inconsistent(changed)
				if tamped -> recovery 


	#security :
		Attacks on the watermarking security :
			- any malicious attempt toperform unauthorized embedding, removal, or detection of a (valid or invalid) watermark.
				- removal attack : complete removal , eg denoising, quantization
					statitical : treat the watermark as signal noise which can be statistically modeled and removed.
					collusion : 
				- geometric attack : distortion, shearing , rotaion
				- crypto attack : o remove the embedded watermark information or to embed misleading watermarks
				- protocol attack : re-watermarking an image with a second owne
					- Mosaic attack: The web-crawler scans the Internet for images and checks for the
							distributor’s mechanism which, if detected, can be recorded. o chop an image into small tiles, which can be 
							imperceptibly rendered by a browser to look the same as a single image
					- Copy Attack: “The goal of the attack it to copy a watermark  from stego data to the target data without having any specific 
						knowledge about the watermarking technology” and “the goal of the attack is not to destroy the embedded
						watermark, but jeopardize the application for which digital watermarks are used

PPT 4 : DIGITAL FORENSICS :
	# procedures : I CAPE A RTR
		1. Identification : search for, recognition and documentation of potential digital evidence at an incident scene
		2. Collection : potentially contain digital evidence are removed to a laboratory or another controlled environment for later acquisition and 
			analysis. The collection step involves the gathering of physical devices that may contain potential digital evidence from its original 
			location and documenting all the collected items .
		3. Acquisition : involves producing an image of potential digital evidence and and documenting the method.
		4. Preservation : ial digital evidence should be preserved to ensure its usefulness for investigating incidents and to protect the integrity 
			of the evidence.
		5. Examination : In-depth systematic search of evidence relating to the suspected crime needs to be done prior to performing a full analysis. T
		6. Analysis : study of specific, internal attributes of the data. draws conclusions based on evidence found.
		7. Reporting : final reports should contain important details from each step, including References to protocols follow.
			No conclusion should be written without a thorough description of the supporting evidence
		8. Testimony : necessary to present the findings outlined in a report and address related questions before decision makers can reach a 	
			conclusion
		9. Returing evidence :

	# various types of forensics :
		*investigation , gathering and analyis

		expensive
		lack of evidence to prove justification
		tempered data

		- computer : extraction raw data , database , suspicious code 
		- mobile : pjone record , text message , GMS , GPS , emails , 
			use : miltary , call centers  , law , 
		- memory : analysis of volatile data( browsing history, chat messages, and clipboard contents) in computer's memory dump (snapshot capture of 
		  computer memory data from a specific instant). 
		- network : examination of the network and its traffic going across a network that is suspected to being involved in malicious activities
			cyber attacks , file tranfers , emails , history 
			challenges :
				- manage the data generated during the process
				- Address Spoofing (ip)

			adv : 
				- checks for vurnebalites
				- analyeses , indentifes treats
				- reduce downtime.

		- multimedia : ultimedia forensics involves the set of techniques used for the analysis of multimedia signals like audio, video, images
				reveal identify validate retrieve 

				image authentication :
					active :  authentication code is embedded in the image at the time of
						image generation or sent with the image for accessing its integrity at the receiving end.
						Verifying this code authenticates the originality of the image .
						digital signatures, digital watermarking.
					passive : uses the only image with no prior information for accessing the integrity of the image
						forgery type dependent : 
							copy move detection : It involves copying some regions in the image and moving the same to some other region in the imag
							image splicing : involves merging 2 or more images, changing the original image significantly to create a forged image
						forgery type independent :  n artifact traces left during the process of re-sampling and due to lighting inconsistencie 
							Retouching detection : Find the blurring, enhancements, or color changes and illumination changes in the forged image
	
	# anti-forensics : Anti-forensic aims to make investigations on digital media more difficult and therefore more expensive

		These are the general anti-forensic categories discussed in this document:
			● Data hiding, obfuscation, and encryption : NFTS me chupa dena data ko
			● Trail Blackout : attackers delete or modify the information of some vital files to confuse
			● Falsification of data : 
			● Overwriting data/metadata:
			● Data deletion and physical destruction
			● Encryption
			● Online anonymity : incognito mode
