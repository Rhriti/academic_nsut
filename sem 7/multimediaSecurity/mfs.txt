Summary :

PPT 1 :
	
	Multimedia is the medium which provides information to the users in the form of text, audio, video, animation and graphics
	data-driven and object-oriented, allows applications with cooperative end-user innovation and personalization. 

	characterstics : [sooffaa]
		- stage , record , transmit , play 
		- file formats for enchancing user experience
		- in form on analog or digial
		- object oriented and data driven

	desirable features :
		- high processing power
		- various supporing file formats
		- efficient I/O
		- storages 
		- networks

	components of multimedia :
		- recording
		- softwares for eding purpose
		- storages 
		- displays

	categories of multimedia :
		- linear : Linear active content progresses without any navigational control for the viewer. [cinema]
		- non linear : offers user interactivity to control the progress [ hypermedia ].

	applications :
	    - buisness : adversting / selling products
	    - research and medicine 
	    - entertainment purpose
	    - public purposes

	MOV , MP4 , FLV , FLAC , 3PG

	features of multimedia :
		- text audio video pictures animations intereactivty

    MULTIMEDIA CODING 
    Transformation of a string of characters in some representation (such as ASCII) into a new string that contains the same information as the original 
    but length is small as possible. [data compression]

    Shannon’s Communication System Model
        source --- encoding ----> transmit ---- decoding ---> reciever

    why image compression can be done ?
    	 - spatial redundancy
    	 - specteral redundancy
    	 - pysho-visual redundancy

    image compressed ?  Raw image -> [transformer]------[quatiser] --symbols----- [encoder] -- steam of bits\
    keyword : ameable  to compression, scalar and vector quantisation.

    image compresion 2 type [make the diffence table ]
    	KEYS : data elimination, restoration , quality , algo used , file size , use case

    	- lossless :  run length encoding  , huffman coding [(gready) util min heap contains two frequecies/probabilties ]
    	- lossy : transform coding [ffts]

    -------------------------------------------

    COLOR 
    spectrum of light being perceived by the human visual system
    tint, shade, hue, brightness, luminance, color, chromaticity
	Spectral Power Distribution (SPD) of a light is a function P(λ) which defines the power in the light at each wavelength

	3d color spaces :
	  - cubic [rgb]
	  - polar [brigtness , hue]
	  - opposite [r-g b-y black-white]

	 Luminance : dark and light properties 
	 	Luminance, Intensity, Brightness, Lightness
	 chromaticity : 
	 	hue : dominant wavelenght 
	 	saturation/brightness : pure/deep realted to gray

	 The color gamut describes a range of colors within the spectrum of colors, or a color space, that can be reproduced on an output device
	 example : phospor screen

	 RGB space , additive colors
	 CMY space , subractive colors

PPT 2 :
	Stegnography 

	2 words se bna hai [stegno : cover , graphy : writing ]

	one pince of information and hides into another.

	invisible inks, microdots.


	difference table :

	cover, structure remains same , stegno media , confidentialy , attack is called stegnoanalysis


	classfication :
		- pure 
		- public key
		- private key

	principles :
		- significant chnages aren't made while embedding into images
		- human inability to distinguish/hard to detect by visual  

	techniques :
		- substitution
	 	- injections
	 	- generate a new file

	Text Stenography
		- line shift 
		- word shift
		- certain features

	audio stenography
		- sample quantisation
		- temporal sampling rate

	image stenography
		- LSB


	can;t protect watermark
	password leakage 
	third party
	degrade or render the image


	digital watermarking 
	printers
	medicine 


	steganalysis : practice of attaching stegnography methods for detection , extraction , destruction , alteration

	Classification of attacks : [vo all possible combinations]

	Approaches :
		- visual 
		- structural  [patterns]
		- statistical [mathematical formulas]

	Techniques :
	    - signature : looks for repititive patterns
	    - statistical : statics undergo alteration while 
	         - specific : detailed knowledge of embbedding process
	         - universal : no priori knowledge required, learning models like neural networks
