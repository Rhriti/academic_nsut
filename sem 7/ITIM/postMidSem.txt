Chapter 14 : CLOUD COMPUTING 
	cloud computing : Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand
			network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be
			rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service
			provider interaction.

			5-characterstics
				- on demand self-service
				- rapid elasticity
				- Resource pooling
				- Measured service
				- Broad network access 

			4-deployement model
			 	- private
			 	- public
			 	- community
			 	- hybrid

			3-service model
				- SaaS , IaaS , PaaS

	Infrastructure as code :
		earlier Systems managers installed operating systems from an installation medium,	added libraries and 
		applications, patched the system to the latest softwareversions, and configured the software to this 
		specific installation.
		As an alternative, servers, storage, and networks can be created and configured automatically, a concept known as infrastructure as code


											version control
										/					\
								standard templates		config defination
										|						|
									creation tool 			config tool
											  config registry


		· Standard templates are defined that describe the basic setup of infrastructure components.
		· Configurations of infrastructure components are defined in configuration definitions.
		· New instances of infrastructure components can be created automatically by a creation tool, using the standard templates. This leads
			to a running, unconfigured infrastructure component.
		· After an infrastructure component is created, the configuration tool automatically configures it, based on the configuration definitions, 
		   leading
			to a running, configured infrastructure component.
		· When the new infrastructure component is created and configured, its properties, like DNS name and if a server is part of a load balancer 		
			pool,are automatically stored in the configuration registry.
		· The configuration registry allows running instances of infrastructure to recognize and find each other and ensures all needed components 
			are running.
		· Configuration definition files and standard templates are kept in a version control system, which enables roll backs and rolling upgrade

Chapter 10 : COMPUTE 

	10.2 Building Blocks : 
		
		compute housing : rank mounted servers and blade servers
		
		processors : pura CAO (inst -> binary code -> machine code -> memonics -> assembly language ) , registers , words
				intel x86 , amdx86
		
		memory : vaccum tubes , relays , magnetic disks 
			RAM : "Random" means that any piece of data stored in RAM can be read in the same amount of time, regardless of its physical location  
			RAM either stores a bit of data in a flip-flop circuit, as implemented in SRAM (static RAM), or as a charge in a capacitor, as 
			implemented in DRAM (dynamic RAM).

			BIOS : 	controls a computer from the moment it is powered on, a set of instructions stored on a memory chip located on the computer’s motherboard
			interfaces : Connecting computers to external peripherals is done using interfaces
				RS-232, USB, and Thunderbolt 

		Compute Virtualisation : introduces an abstraction layer between physical computer hardware and and the operating system using that hardware
			Virtualization decouples and isolates virtual machines from the physical machine and from other virtual machines by means of a 
				virtualization layer.
			Virtual machines can be started and stopped independently from each other. And if one virtual machine crashes, the others are isolated 
				from the failure and are unaffected

			full cloud computing walla part

			- software defined compute (SDC) : Virtual machines are typically managed using one redundant centralized virtual machine

			- disadvantage of Vir. :
					- vir.machines tend to get created for all kinds of reasons (virtual machine sprawl)
					- introduces extra layer which needs to be managed.
					- can't be done on all servers., req specialiesed hardware.
					- confirgration is not supported for an application on the server.

			- technologies
				- emulation : An emulator is a piece of software that allows programs to run on a computer system other than the one they were 
					originally intended for.
				- logical partioning : is a subset of a computer's hardware resources, virtualized as a separate computer.
					physical machine can be partitioned into multiple logical partitions, each hosting a separate operating system.

				- hypervisors : VMM
						binary transalating
						paravirtuilisatio
						hardware assisted virtualisation

			- virtual memory management
				- memory overcommit : operating systems claim more memory than they actually use. memory overcommit the hypervisor assigns more memory 
					to the combined virtual machines than is physically available in the computer
				
				- memory sharing : Memory sharing maps identical memory pages in one or more virtual machines to a single page of physical memory.
					If a virtual machine attempts to write to the shared page, the hypervisor allocates a new copy of the page with read-write 
					permissions for that virtual machine.

		container technology : Container technology is a server virtualization method in which the kernel of an operating system provides multiple
		 	isolated user-space instances, instead of just one. Containers look and feel like a real server from the point of view of its
			owners and users, but they share the same operating system kernel
		
		mainframes : optimized for high I/O throughput
		supercomputers :designed to maximize calculation speed.

	10.3 compute availabilty : 
		- Hot swappable components :  are server components like memory, CPUs, interface cards, and power supplies that can be installed, replaced, or 
			upgraded while the server is running. server must have specific circuitry .server hardware must be aware that components can be swapped on 
			the fly.

		- Parity and ecc memory : parity bits can be used as the simplest form of error detecting code
			"Error Correction Codes" : humming codes

		- Lockstepping : Lockstepping is an error detection and correction technology for servers. In lockstepping, multiple systems perform the same
		 	calculation, and the results of the calculations are compared. If the results are equal, the calculations were correctly performed. If 
		 	there are different outcomes, one of the servers made an error.
		 	can't be done when only 2 servers.

		- Virtualiation Availability : failover clustering Using a spare physical machine,  All machines used

	10.4 Compute performance : 
			Moore's law : Moore's law states that the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit doubles 
			approximately every two years
			n we see a doubling of CPU performance every 18 months

		increasing CPU speed and performace :
			- increasing clock speed 
			- CPU caching
			- pipelining 
			- prefecting and branch prediction
			- superscalar CPU's
			- hyperthreading
			- multicore CPUs

	10.5 Computer Security :
		Physical security : 
		 	- disable USB ports
		 	- password 
		 	- detect unusal activites (pattern recognistion bleh bleh)

		virtualisation security :
			- firewalls , intrusion detection system

Chapter 11 : OPERATING SYSTEM 
	building blocks : OS ka likh dena lol
		- process scheduling
		- file systems
		- API and system calls
		- device drivers
		- memory management
		- Shell gui cli

	Availablity :
		Failover clustering :
			cluster hote hai withing active node , there are some passive nodes also present , when active node fails passive node does the work.
			active and passive nodes are connected by heartbeat. keeps acknowledgement 
			N+1 cluster .....
			N+N cluster -> equal distributing of load

			voting and quorum disks : how do nodes check the status of other nodes : 
			problem : 
				- each nodes may decide that other nodes are down and becomes the active one
				- Each node decides that it has lost contact with the active cluster, so both nodes decide to stop
			solution :
				quorum disk is attached to one of the cluster , . The quorum disk acts as one vote in the voting system

	Performance :
		- increase memory : paging and swapping
		- decresing kernel size : leading to a lower risk of crashes and a smaller security attack surface.

	Security :
	 	- Patching : updates vagerah to fix bugs
	 		regular patches : normal bugs / low priority bugs
	 		hot fixes : fix asap/ high prior/ can occur due to fixing other bugs
	 		service packs : collection of above both, can be done in one deployement
	 	- hardening : step by step process of config operating system. un-necessary protocols are switched off. 
	 	- virus scanning : 
	 	- firewalls :
	 	- limiting user accounts

				Passive fire protection – measures to limit the exposure of the fire once it has started (installation of fire resistant walls, 
						floors, and ceilings).
				Fire detection systems – systems to detect smoke and fire.
				Fire suppression systems – systems to extinguish the fire once it is detected. (heat fuel oxygen )

		Equipment racks :
			normal racks ka likh dena 
			KVM switches : (keyboard video mouse) A KVM switch is a hardware device that allows a user to control multiple
				servers from a single keyboard, video monitor, and mouse.
 		
 		Datacenter cabling and patching :
 			The demarcation point is usually a cable strip in a locked location of which one part can only be accessed by the telecom provider and the 
 				other part only by the systems managers.
			If possible two or more demarcation points should be installed in the datacenter, to avoid a single point of failure

	go live scenario :
		Big bang : e existing system is switched off and the new system is immediately put in production , impossible to roll back after live
		parallel changeover : run old and new simultaneoulsy for few months and migrate karte rhao , though this is costly , maintaince , sync both
		phased changeover : indivisual components migrate one by one , Also, the existing system must be kept online until the last component or 
		functionality is moved to the new system, which can lead to high cost.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 17 : MAINTAINCE
	17.2 Monitoring 
		error conditions or signs of (upcoming) failures, like a disk with only little free space left, unusually high CPU utilization, or extreme 
		network bandwidth usage.
	- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) can be used to remotely change or update configurations and collect statistics and
	  performance information of infrastructure components. Devices that support SNMP include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers.
	  SNMP also supports so-called traps. A trap is an alarm that is sent to the NMS	

	- Logging : generate log data , Log data can also be used to identify trends to predict or even prevent unavailability, or to find security
	  vulnerabilities or security breaches.
