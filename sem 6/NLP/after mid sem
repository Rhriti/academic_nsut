UNIT 3.
	unit 12 -> suruat ke topicsm
	CFG -> 12.2 there can be recursion in CFG

	this whole below is covered in unit 13 from the book
	NPTEL lecture 22 - 27 [consituentcy parsing and dependency]
	stanford video 88 - 91 [cyk algorith along with probabbiltites with backtracking to find the tree]
	so basically extrating grammer from CFG is polynomial time , since production rules can be n-ary
	so there is need of binarisation, reduce to CNF , onto which now CYK algo can be appiled in O(N^3) time.

	now some topics are left(last ke topics) jo maam ne notes daal rahkhe hia on classroom but we found videos on yt yayyaya
	feature structures and two important operations on feature structures, namely, subsumption and unification.
