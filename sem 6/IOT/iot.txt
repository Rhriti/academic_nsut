----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PPT 2 :	MAIN COMPONENETS 

	sense user : motion, location, camera... (sense the surroudings)
	sense objects : check for availbilty in the model or the need (pressure sensor , volume sensor , previous records, history)
	decision making : make decision on set of predefined or dynamic rules.
	notify : gives outpur oe desired communication using alarms, notifs, message, info over protocols etc 

	so IoT has 5 stuff : (components of iot)	
		- Thing : the actual device or model
		- Controller : the processor 
		- Sensor : i/p
		- Actuators : o/p
		- Communicators : connect, transmit data

	An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system, for example by opening a valve. In 
	simple terms, it is a "mover".Its main energy source may be an electric current, hydraulic pressure, or pneumatic(pressurised gas) pressure.

	no of devices connected are 2 folds 5

	The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software,
	and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks

PPT 3 : ABOUT IoT
	IoP vs IoT
	IoP :Internet of People refers to the digitalization of relationships between people and the collection, processing and application of personal 
		data. It forms a network of collective intelligence and stimulates interactive communication among our digital selves through digital devices, 
		theinternet and sharing of data

	Evolution of IoT :
	People connected with things : smart watch , band , mobiles
	Things connected with things : servers , database, providers 
	
	where is IoT ? everywhere :clown:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PPT 4 : APPLICATIONS OF IoT
	smart homes: lightning heating security entertainment smart tv , refrigrator lcd , cameras and 	home alarm ,burglary
	wearables: fitness, bands, text msgs , calls, step counts , smart clothes 
	connected health: sensors to monitor patient condition in real time. collect health data
	smart retail: tags on clothes , online payment
	smart farming : soil moisture, presence of nutrients, data collection etcc..

PPT 5 : EMBEDDED SYSTEMS 

	real time systems : tasks are related with time constraints. The tasks assigned to real-time systems need to be completed in given time 
	interval. hard and soft real time system (based on flexibility) . stock trading , miltary stuff , gps trackes , 
	
	embedded systems :  It can be said as a dedicated computer system which has been developed for some particular reason. But it is not our
	traditional computer system or general purpose computers, these are the Embedded systems which may work independently or attached to a 
	larger system to work on few specific functions. These embedded systems can work without human intervention or with a little human 
	intervention
	example washing machine , smart watches , printers , microwave oven, refrigrator 
	
	Typically implemented using MCU

	many embedded systems can combine to form a whole working model :
	ex : motor bike : speed , wheel rotation , fuel levels , heartrate 
	automated vehicles : cuise(steering) control , automatic air bags sensor , location tracking(gps) , air pressure inside the tire, 
	surroundings
	or some other areas like :  ABS;navigation system,collision avoidance system; tire pressure monitoring; lane warning; adaptive 
	cruise control; climate control; airbag control unit; electric window and central locking; parking aid; automatic wiper control; alarm

PPT 6 : HCI (HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION)
	Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer technology and, in particular, 
	the interaction between humans (the users) and computers.
	A central objective of HCI is to make computer systems more user-friendly and mre usable. 
    HCI is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use

    Interfaces : GUI(hardware , touch) , VUI (speech , gesture , VR)

    seven design principles :
	   - Equitable use : same means for all users
	   - Flexibility in use
	   - Simplicity and intuitiveness of use 
	   - Tolerance for error
	   - Perceptible information
	   - Low physical effort
	   - Size and space for approach and use 

	Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that 
	is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves”

	 Smartphone adjusts the screen to the orientation of the device
	 Apple Watch turns on display if arm lifted/rotated
	 Orientation is determined by using both a gyroscope and an accelerometer
	 auto brightness using light sensor
	 location using gps
	 touch screen proximity sensor 

	challenges :
		complexity : complex system doesn't means better performance , but may be hard to maintain.
		Error : 
		privacy
		user preferences 
		information overloaded : system hi hang karne lag jaye , so we need to decide what to include and what not to include in out model.  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PPT 7 : SENSORS
	a sensor is a device that recieves a stimulus and respond with an electrical signal.
	detect changes in the env
	response :  a signal which can be channeled, amplified, and modified by electronic devices
	transducers :A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form to another. Usually a transducer converts a signal in one form of 
	energy to a signal in another.

	ways of I/O :
		UART (universal asynchronous reciever/transmitter)
		SPI (serial peripherial interface) send any no of bits without any interuption
		I2C (inter integrated circuit)
		GPIO (general purpose i/o) A general-purpose input/output (GPIO) is an uncommitted digital signal pin on an integrated circuit or 
			electronic circuit board which may be used as an input or output, or both, and is controllable by the user at runtime.

	one of the ADC method : successive approximation method
		converts a continuous analog waveform into a discrete digital representation via a binary search through all possible quantization 
		levels before finally converging upon a digital output for each conversion

		algo :
		- we use lot of trail voltage to get value of unkown input signal
		- number of trial voltages = number of bits used to encode the signal
		- First trial voltage is 1/2 the full scale range of the ADC
		- if (remainder of input voltage > trial voltage) bit value 1 is entered , else 0 is entered
		- successive bits are multiplied to their corresponding trail voltage and added up.

		trail_vol = full_scale/2;
		input_vol 
		A
		for(n bits){
			if(input_vol > trail_vol ) A{1 , trail_vol}  input_vol -= trail_vol
			else A{0 , trail_vol}
			trail_vol/=2;
		}
		total = sum(A[i][0] * A[i][1])

		no of quantisation level = 2^bits
		resolution = full scale voltage / no of quantisation level
		quantisation error  = resolution / 2; [ ie 1/2 of interval  idk]

	DAC : E = E' * sum[(2^x)^(-1)Bi]  x:{1...n}  [0.5, 0.25, 0.125 ....]

	types of sensor : 
		based on output 
			- analog(continuous output) LDR , accelometer
			- digital(discreate output 0/1) door sensor
		based in data type
			- scalar (only magnitude matters) temperature
			- vector (position and orinetation also matters)sound , velocity , gives coordinates
		hardware and software sensor

	sensor resolution : the min change req in the env that sensor can detect

	characterstics : 
		- high sensitive     - linearity  ( out is directly prop to input)
		- high resolution 	 - less noise
		- no deviation from external factors over no of trials 

	active sensor : need external power supply, battery, send signal into environment and measure interaction of signal w/ env, radar sonar
	passive sensor : do not need external power supply , record signals already present in environment , video camera 

	errors in sensor :
		offset/bias : default error we get without any input
		drift : output changes due to the change in the hardware over year, physical change
		hysteris : different output for same input value
		quantisation error : exists in digital system while conversion from analog to digital
	
	components of sensor :
		- power unit
		- sensing unit ( sensor , ADC)
		- procession unit (mcu)
		- transmission unit (radio)

	actuators : converts source energy to mechanical motion for example by opening a valve. In simple terms, it is a "mover". 
		Hardware devices that convert a controller command signal into a change in a physical parameter
		types : 
			electrical (motor)
			hydraulic:  The mechanical motion gives an output in terms of linear, rotatory or oscillatory motion. As liquids are nearly 
			impossible to compress, a hydraulic actuator can exert a large force. The drawback of this approach is its limited acceleration.
			pneumatic (compressed gas)  produced from relatively small pressure changes

PPT 8 : IOT architecture and standards
	overview layered structure
		sensing layer : sensors and actuators 
		network layer : internet and gateway
		data processing layer : data analysis and decision unit platform(API, protocols)
		application layer : connected applications 
	Edge Computing  :
		Computation takes place at the edge of a device’s network, which is known as edge computing.With this technology, data is processed 
		and transmitted to the devices instantly. Yet, edge nodes transmit all the data captured or generated by the device regardless of the 
		importance of the data. Edge computing helps devices to get faster results by processing the data simultaneously received from the 
		devices. 
	Fog computing :
		It is a layer in between the edge and the cloud. When edge computers send huge amounts of data to the cloud, fog nodes receive the 
		data and analyze what’s important. Then the fog nodes transfer the important data to the cloud to be stored and delete the unimportant 
		data or keep them with themselves for further analysis. In this way, fog computing saves a lot of space in the cloud and transfers 
		important data quickly.
	Cloud Computing :
		Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of IT services/resources over the internet.
	[give example of real time temperature sensor]

	iot gateway :
		Gateway acts as a medium to open up connection between cloud and controller(sensors / devices). A gateway can be a typical hardware 
		device or software program.
		it also performs many other tasks such as this IoT gateway performs protocol translation (like using MQTT), aggregating all data, 
		local processing and filtering of data before sending it to cloud, locally storing data and autonomously controlling devices based on 
		some inputted data, providing additional device security. 

		Working of IoT Gateway :
			Receives data from sensor network.
			Performs Pre processing, filtering and cleaning on unfiltered data.
			Transports into standard protocols for communication.
			Sends data to cloud.


	iot standards :
		Multiple regulation bodies and industry alliances are standardizing the means by which devices can interact with each another and with 
		gateways or cloud services.

	The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 
		- deals with defining protocols for wireless access network
		- targeting bands like 2.4GHz, 5GHz, 900MHz , modules like ZigBee builds , HaLow

		- Session layer : creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices  , authentication, permissions 
		- Transport layer :(port no) transport layer carries out flow control, sending data at a rate that matches the connection speed of the 
			receiving device, and error control, checking if data was received incorrectly and if not, requesting it again.
		- Network layer : (IP ADDRESS) routing and switching 
			2 function - 
		       breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end
		       routing packets by discovering the best path across a physical networ
		- Data layer : (MAC)establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network. It breaks up packets into 
			frames and sends them from source to destination.

	infrastructure network [diagram]
		- station :terminal with access mechanisms to the wireless medium and radio contact to the access point
		- access point : station integrated into the wireless LAN and the distribution system
		- portal : bridge to other (wired) networks ,portal is used when other family of 802 is connected
		- distributed system : multiple access points are connected to form distribution system
		- Basic service set (bss) :group of stations using the same radio frequency

		station ----wireless(bss)--> access point -> portal ---- wired ---> 802.11x

			 - probe res sent from access point 
			 - assocation request sent from host to access point 
			 - assocation response sent from access point to host 

			passive (access point initiates)
			 - Beacons sent from Access Points
			 - assocation request sent from host to access point 
			 - assocation response sent from access point to host 

	infrastructureless network (adhoc network [temporary network]) 
	  	no need of infrastructure
	  	eg Mobile Adhoc network

	  	MANET :
	  		totoally wireless , no fixed infrastructure, dynamic topologies
	  		node in manet can act as host or router accordingly

	  	2 points main : mobile , no fixed infrastructure

	  	characterstics : dynamic topo, energy constrained (as they are mobile) , 
	  	prop : fast network establishment , P2P connection , No access point requred , wireless 
	  	challenges : routing(As nodes are mobile) , topology , security , bandwith , energy

	 	An ad-hoc routing protocol is a convention that controls how nodes decide which way to route packets between computing devices in a mobile ad-hoc networ
		types based on routing info update 
			- proactive (table driven routing ) Route information always available; no need to search for route
				adv : minimum time to find route
				dis : priodically  info exchange req, so table has to be updated continuuly
					high netork overload
					high bandwidth consumption
					not suited for large networks
				 eg :STAR 
				 	 DSDV (destination Sequenced Distance Vector Routing Protocol) based on bellmenford algo
				 	 GSR (Global State Routing) : based on Dijkstra’s 
			
			- reactive (obtain route when req)
				adv = ~dis above
				dis : time to discover route is non predictabel
				 eg DSR (dynamic source routing) [flood-fill algo]
				 	bfs , Route Request (RREQ)  , Route Reply (RREP)
			
			- Geographic
				Nodes use location information to make routing decision,sender must know the locations of itself, the destination, and its neighbor
					Unicast Location-Based Routing :
						Each forwarding node makes localized decision based on the location of the destination and the node’s neighbors (greedy forwarding)
						challenge : may arrive to a node which doesnt have any neighbours  (holes , voids)
					Geocasting :
						Packet is sent to all or some nodes within specific geographic region
						challenge  : distribute packet near or in the target region (flooding)
				 eg CEDAR

PPT 12 : HTTP AND REST
	cloud computing : Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool 
	of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management 
	effort or serive provider interaction.	(oh my ~NSIT~  NIST )
	adv :pay per use , scalable , flexble elastic , anywhere access 
	IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
	Virtualization is the process of abstracting the physical resources to the pool of virtual resources that can be given to any virtual machines (VMs).

	SaaS: complete solution including application(s) Google Apps
	PaaS: computer + OS (incl. development environment) Heroku
	IaaS: barebones computer  Amazon Web Services (AWS)

	clouds for IOT : thingSpeak ,AWS IoT

	HTTP 

	response is a sequence of bytes with an associated MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) type
	response can be static(files , audio , images) or dynamic(on-the-fly)in nature 

	Each file managed by a server has a unique name called a URL
	can be static or dynamic(fds?fd)

	request : <method> <uri> <version>
	<method> is either 
		GET retrieve information, 
		POST send data to the server,
		HEAD Same as GET, no data in response body, 
		PUT, Write a file to the server
		DELETE,  Delete a file on the server
		TRACE Echo request in response body
		OPTIONS, 

	response : <version> <status code> <status msg>
		200 OK Request was handled without error
		403 Forbidden Server lacks permission to access file
		404 Not found Server couldn’t find the fil

	REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines the constraints to create web services.
	REST is an architectural style, or design pattern, for APIs.
	It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.
	[examples]

	3 fundamental aspects : resource , URL , simple operations
	3 concepts : resource[endpoints] , verbs[GET POST PUT DELETE] , Representation (data format [JSON XML]) 
	
	Axioms by tim lee 
	Axiom 0: all resources on the Web must be uniquely identified with a URI.

PPT 13 : RFID
	Radio Frequency Identification
	- for identification and tracking 
	RFID tags are attached to the objects and the contains electronic stored information.

	RFID tag -> chip -> antenna -> covering
	
	components of RFID system :
		- RFID reader 
		- RFID tag
		- antenna 
		- software

	RFID tag : contains chip which contains info of onject being tagged, It sends response. transmits data to RFID reader with radio frequency is encountered
		tags can be passive and active in nature
		active : self power , expensive , battery , long range , usefil on tracking and locating stuff	
		passive : depends on RFID reader for power , cheap in nature , used in short distance , used for identification purposes

	RFID reader :
		contains two way radio transmitter receiver (transceiver)
		 - reader me antenna hota hai to send the signal and activate the chip
		 - also ek decoder hota hao to interpret receiving data

		 can be fixed or mobile in nature 

	Antenna : helps in communication btw reader and tag

	software : used for storing and interpretting the data 

	ADVANTAGES : 
		No line of sight required for reading
		Multiple items can be read with a single scan
		uses EPC (electroninc product code )

	RFID vs BARCODE
		barcode  : 
			optical technology
			UPC (universal product code)
			unlimited shelf life but are degraded with time 
			can be easily duplicated and reattached
			size comparison
		RFID
			radio technology
			EPC(electonic product code)
			tags have no moving parts so unlimimted life span 
			diifcult to duplicate 

	Applications :security , retail shop , tracking , manufacturing 

	NFC (near field communication)
		NFC is based on RFID technology that uses magnetic field induction between electronic devices in close proximity
		distance less than 20 cm 
		contactless data transfer btw the devices 
		bidirectional communication (P2P)

	NFC are passive 
	NFC device is capable of being both an NFC reader and an NFC tag.
	Only one NFC can be scanned at a time		 
	eg : contactless payment , ticketicng , attendace marking , wireless pairing , UPIs

PPT 14 : MQTT
	Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
	It is event based IoT middleware works in publish subscribe with predictable bi-directional message delivery.
	componenets :
		publisher subscriber broker 
	[diagram][eg teemperature]
	Message have a topic, quality of service, and retain status associated with them.

	 - clients don't know each other , they only know the IP and port of the broker
	 - clients don't have to run at the same time
	 - hierarchy is used for the topics
	 - maybe possible the clients message is never consumed by subscriber

	Topic : its is an identifier by MQTT broker to identify the righful clients for delivering the message
		each published data has a topic associated to it , and the subcrised subscriber will recieve it.
		eg : /home/rooms/kitchen/temperature

	Wildcards can be used to subscribe to multiple topics.
	eg home/hall/temp
	   home/+/temp
	   home/#

	subscriptiom : durable , non-durable
	uses TCP on transport layer (1883 port)

	MQTT supports three Quality of Service (QoS) levels. This specifies if a message has guaranteed delivery.
		QoS 0 ‘At most once delivery’ – Best effort delivery, no response is sent from the receiver and no retry is performed by the sender. 
				Fire and forget This is the most efficient.
		QoS 1 ‘At least once delivery’ – Ensures the message is received at least once, however multiple duplicate messages are possible.(2 message overhaed ,[sent , pub_ack])
		QoS 2 ‘Exactly once delivery’ – Highest QoS and incurs the most overhead and the slowest (4 overhead)

	MQTT message format : see block diagram 
	shortest msg of 2 bytes 

	bits 	0 	1 	2 	3 	| 	4 	|	5 	6 	|	7 	
	byte 1 	  message type     DUP 	  	QoS		  retain 
	byte 2 		reaminaing length (1-4 bytes)
	byte 3 	
	  .
	  .				optional variable length header
	  .
	byte m
	  .
	  .				optional variable message payload
	  .
	byte n

	message types : connect , PUBLISH , SUBSCRIBE , PUBACK (pub ack) , PUBREC (pub recieved) ,PUBREL (publish release), PUBCOMP (publish complete) 
	DUP : Duplicate msg flag , indicating that message has already been recieved 
	QoS level : 
	RETAIN : to ratain the last published  message and serve it first to new subscription
	remaining length : baki bacha hua msg



	SMQTT (secure MQTT) Protocol 
		is session layer protocol.
		uses light weight attribute based encryption.
		Algorithm is divided into four parts viz. setup, encryption, publish and decryption. [IMP]
		Key generation algorithm is not standardized and depends on developers. Encryption algorithms depend on developers too.
		In the setup phase, subscribers and publishers register themselves with broker and obtain master secret key.
