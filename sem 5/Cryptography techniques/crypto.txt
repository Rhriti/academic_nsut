CIA -> confidentiality , integrity , availability 
threat (potentail of voilation of securiy )  
attack ( delibrate attemp to breach security )

OSI MODEL ->
	security attack -> actions that compromises security
		passive : learn and make use of info , no change in info , still attacker get many info from location , frequcny etc about type of data being send , hard to detect 
			release of msg contents : try to read messages eaavesdropping (secreatly listening to messages)
			traffic analysis : loactiton , host , frequency of data sent , length of data sent .

		active : modification of data stream or insertion of new data streeams . hard to prevent

			masquarade : steals someones crediantials to act like the host itself.
			replay : capture info and send it again and again 
			modification of messages : 
			denial of services : overloading server , and server unable to repond to the one who need it. 

	security services -> enhance the security /protection , provide services.
		data confidentilty :
		data integrity :
		authentication : proves the identity of the claim , gmail login OTP
		access control : who can access what 
		nonrepudiation : proof that msg was sent by transmiiting party and proof that msg was recived by recieving party.	(u can't deny it once you are done sending or recieving)

	security mechanisms -> detect , prevent and recover from security attack
		encipherment :
		digital signature : prove the identity of sender
		access control :
		data integrity :
		authentication exchange : entities some msg to each other to prove their identity 
		traffic pading : introduce dummy data stream when both entities are idle.
		routing control : 
		notarization : trusted third party is used to control communication bt the two entities

cryptography -> defination , block diagram etc 

cryptanalsis -> trying to decode the cipher text by attack , they try to find key based on some patterns , observation etc or use his previos knowledge to detect relationships etc 

bruteforce attack  -> trying all posible cmbination , can be prevneted using captcha etc to slow down process .
