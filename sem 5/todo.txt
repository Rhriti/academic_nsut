HEY THIS IS SPEAKING FROM 21 NOV 
--------------------------------------------------------END SEM----------------------------------------------------------
you will soon have practical classed hopefully  next week , but you know they won't be much productive , so might be spending most of the time in
making practical files [29 nov - 5 dec]

the next week you will be having PRACTICAL OFFLINE EXAMS. (need to read theory before that). [6 dec - 13 ]

the next 2 weeks would be OFFLINE EXAMS  ~:PANIC:~  :KALM: [13 onwards]

----------------------------->
Marks distribution( For practical waale subject) -- 

Mse = 25
Ese = 50
Class test + Internals = 10
Practicals = 15

----------------------------->
DM practical evaluation -- (⌛ Next week submit karna hai)

Project
Make project in DM and PPT to explain that project (Jiske grp banaye thay pahle) 

Practical
- Classify data using decision tree, k nearest, naive bayes, bayseian believe network, linear or logistic regresssion, svm
- Visualize it, ss in file, hyperparameter value change karo and note the changes in the model
-Check the model using different measures (eg. F1 score, recall etc.)

UPD : [DONE EZ :)]

----------------------------->
Crypto ESE 

50 marks
5 question with parts, 10marks per question
3-4 parts for each question (1 or 2 numerical in each question)

❎ Not in syllabus
Unit2 - Elliptic curve

✅Important topics
RSA, Diffie Hellman

[5:15 pm, 22/11/2021] ashish: md 5 not in sylabus
[5:17 pm, 22/11/2021] ashish: majorly RSA calculation
[5:17 pm, 22/11/2021] ashish: 3 question per unit , attempt 2 only

CLOUD COMPUTING 
	still dont know what to do 

MACHINE LEARNING
	one revision from statquest and we are good to read the ppts hopefully.
	u have read most of the stuff , still u have *must* read the ppts before end of this month , special revisoion of neural network and svm

DATA MINING
_-------------------------->
	
gini index  (examples)
cart algo (examples)
ide3 algo (examples)
regression and classification
bayes theorm (examples)
bayesian belief network (examples)
knn
decision trees (examples)
rule based classifier
linear and logistic regression

see PPTS of these topics : 

svm's : the whole derivation till we find the optimal value as 2/||W||
bagging and boosting : random forest , adaboost , gradient boost(basics)
	there are some practice problems
	ensemble learning 
	holdout and cross validations
interestingness measures  : pattern recognisation and something more too !

association rules  : apriori algorithm (psuedo code and example)
					 pattern growth
					 verticle data format approach
					 lift 
					 x^2 measures
		find a YT video for this 

clustering :
	partitioning measures 
	k-means algo and some variation in it. 
	hierarchical methods (AGNES , DIANA , dendogram)
	centriod , radius

	fuzzy set and fuzzy clustering 
	expectation maximasation algorithm (there is a numerical in the ppt)

  find a YT video for this too !

attribute oriented analysis :

	intial thoughts: donno know what actually is this topic about .
		looks like it something related to x^2 test and correlation among the attributes .
		and to find the covariance . there are screenshot from book though . most of it is the reading part. some numerical examples . lets see it in the end . 

		OBV THIS IS THE END!!!
_-------------------------->

COMPILER CONSTRUCTION
	maam have uploaded notes on classroom , also gate smasher has most of  the syllabus covered. 
	UPD : [ALMOST DONE]

CRYPTOGRAPHY 
	u better start it tomorrow , huge and complex syllabus , u need to do all the upcoming classes . 
	UPD : [I'M CONFUSED IN MAC AND HASH , WT- ]
	i will do after the practicals now

data sheet ->

11 oct POC
12 oct CC
13 oct DM
14 oct ML and crypto


thursday -> 4 days 
   to do -> DM



preprocessing
select attributes
correlation and information gain 
PCA
eigen vector and eigen values 

To-do:

Cloud Computing
//	-unit 1 and 2

Machine Learning
//	- linear regression , multiple variables
//	- Gradient decent
//	- logistic regression
//  - decision tree

Cryptography
//	- Cipher techniques
//	- block ciepher and stream ciepher and feistel structures
//	- AES
//	- operation modes
//	- DES
//	- CR4


POC 
//  compiler assember and interperter preprocessor 
//      phases of compiler  
//      some toc introduction
     
//      lexical analysis -> tokens and  lexime 
     
//      syntax analysis ->  parser tree and chech against the grammer 
//             to study context free grammer 
//             top down parser - > predicate recursive(first and follow )  ,
//             recursive decent parser and LL1 grammer 

//      (semantic analysis)

//      intermeduate code generation 
//      code optimisation 
//      code genereation 

//	- chapter 1
//	- chapter 1b
//	- Toc intro

  
Data Mining 
   
  //  calculate mean , medinaan , mode ,outliers detection formula
	
	// introduction , data , exploring data
	
	// chapter 1 -> intro, defination, challenges, 
	// predictive tasks (classsificatin and regression) ,
	// descriptive tasks (clustering, assosiation analysis, anomaly detection) 

	// chapter 2 -> basic types of data, data quality, precessing techniques, and measures of similarity and dissimilarity 
	// 1.types of data
	// 	types of attribute : 
	// 				nominal , oridnal ,  interval ,ratio 
	// 		on no of value : discreate and continuous 
	// 		asymetric attributes 

	// 	characterstics of data sets :
	// 		dimensionality , spartiality and resolution
		
	// 	types of data sets :
	// 		record data, transaction data, data matrix, documentation
	// 		graph data -> relationship , representation
	// 		ordered data -> relationship changes with time or space 
	// 			sequential data -> record data + time (visiting time in mall)
	// 			sequence data -> genes (postions of ATGC)
	// 			time series data ->  sequential data + time series (taken over time) (eg stocks)
	// 			spatial data -> postion + areas (eg weather geography)

	// 	temporal autocorelation -> if two measurements are close in time, then the values of those measurements are often very similar 
	// 	spatial autocorelation -> objects that are physically close tend to be similar in other ways as well.

	// 2. data quality
	// 	detection and correction (data cleaning)
	// 	algo to tolerate poor data
		



	// chapter 3 -> data exploration, discusses summary statistics, visualization techniques, and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP)



	// - ETL extraction , transformtion ,pipelining
